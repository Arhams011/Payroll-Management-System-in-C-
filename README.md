## Project Particulars

- **Language used for Console Application:** C++
- **Prospective GUI Builder:** [Walnut (Based on the Vulkan Framework)](https://github.com/StudioCherno/Walnut)

### Header Files and Their Uses:

- `#include<iostream>`: C++ header file for input and output streams.
- `#include<stdlib.h>`: Header file for standard library functions in C.
- `#include<conio.h>`: Non-standard header file for console input and output functions.
- `#include<windows.h>`: Windows-specific header file for Windows API functions.
- `#include<time.h>`: Header file for date and time functions.
- `#include<iomanip>`: C++ header file for input and output formatting.
- `#include<ctype.h>`: C header file for character handling functions.

## Rudimentary GUI

Using built-in functions, a rudimentary GUI was created with functions/methods such as:

- `void loginFrame1(int xLenS, int yLenS, int xLenE, int yLenE)`: Utilizes the `gotoXY()` function to position the cursor.
- `void setWindowSize(int width, int height)`: Sets the size of the console window.
- `void border(int xLenS, int yLenS, int xLenE, int yLenE)`: Implements a border around the data.
- `void Cdelay(int msec)`: Delays the program using the `clock()` function.

## Keeping Records - Excel (.xls)

To keep a comprehensive record of the payslips generated by the program, an [Excel file](Records.xls) is generated and updated with each entry. This allows for the tabulation of data and meaningful insights.

## Getting Started

Download the [Project-CoApplication](Project-CoApplication.cpp) file and ensure the presence of non-standard libraries.

## Requirements

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other code editor.
